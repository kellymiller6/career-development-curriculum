## Mod 4 Deliverables:
* Cold Outreach/Networking Deliverable (pick one of these three):
    * [blog post](https://medium.com/@kmil303/jumping-into-open-source-like-a-junior-dev-1212362fdc63).
    * I am using this blog as a way to network through my twitter connections. I've also asked a few in my network to pass
    it on. I am hoping that my blog will communicate a bit about what Turing is and does to help people understand what 
    a rigorous program it is. I also wanted to share my enthusiasm for my new career through this bost. 
    
* Link to your completed Turing portfolio with 2 additional projects:

* Link to reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):
  I used sprints to guide my work during complete-me. My project partner and I during gametime had to cut scope just a little
  bit but did this to focus on creating the best code we could. I also tried my hand at writing a couple of stories during our
  last project.
